'''
There is a leap year every year whose number is perfectly divisible by four - 
except for years which are both divisible by 100 and not divisible by 400. 
The second part of the rule effects century years. 
For example; the century years 1600 and 2000 are leap years, 
but the century years 1700, 1800, and 1900 are not.
